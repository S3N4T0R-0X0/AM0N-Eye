# AM0N-Eye
AM0N-Eye is the decompiled from Cobaltsetrike and has been modified and developed through several aggressor scripts & BOF
is project based on a combination of different ideas and projects used by the threat actor where we observe a set of techniques to evasion EDR and AV while allowing the operator to continue using the tools.

The most focused point for the development is the collection of projects for the Cobaltsetrike (aggressor scripts) and making it an essential feature without the need for to add it every time,Obfuscate the scripts called by the aggressor scripts to activate them at the target,and changed the default c2 profile to change the signature of Cobalt, while maintaining the integration feature with other c2 profiles, and writing new c2 samples for Windows,Linux,MacOS.

This project is not authorized to be published  ‚ö†Ô∏è

# PayloadGenerator

Generates every type of Stageless/Staged Payload based off a HTTP/HTTPS Listener Undetected by antivirus programs
    
Creates /opt/amon-eye/Staged_Payloads, /opt/amon-eye/Stageless_Payloads
    
# Linux & MacOS C2 Server

A security framework for enterprises and Red Team personnel, supports AM0N-Eye penetration testing of other platforms (Linux / MacOS / ...), supports custom modules, and includes some commonly used penetration modules.

Lateral movement
    Generate beacon of Linux-bind / MacOS-bind type
    The target in the intranet runs ./MacOS-bind.beacon <port> to start the service
    Run connect <targetIP>:<port> in the session

Don't forget to Check C2 profiles in /AM0N-Eye/C2-Profiles/ to bypass network filters
To use a custom profile  you must start a AM0N-Eye team server and specify your profile at that tim 
Example ./teamserver [external IP] [password] [/path/to/my.profile] .


# New C2-profile

configuration for memory related to a c2-profile. Here's a breakdown of the information:

1. Allocator and Permissions:
   - allocator: Specifies the method used to allocate memory in a remote process for injected content. It can be either "VirtualAllocEx" or "VirtualAlloc."
   - userwx: Determines the final permissions for injected or buffer overflow (BOF) content. It can be either "false" (RX) or "true" (RWX).

2. Memory Magic Bytes:
   - magic_mz_x86 and magic_mz_x64: Specify the modified magic bytes (MZ) for x86 and x64 architectures, respectively.
   - magic_pe: Specifies the modified magic bytes for the PE header.

3. Stomping and Obfuscation:
   - stomppe: If set to "true," it indicates that the PE header will be stomped (overwritten) during the execution.
   - obfuscate: If set to "true," it suggests that obfuscation techniques will be applied to the code.

4. Cleanup and Sleep Masking:
   - cleanup: If set to "true," it indicates that the post-exploitation UDRL memory will be cleaned up upon loading the post-exploitation DLL.
   - sleep_mask: If set to "true," it implies that memory masking will be applied when sleeping (possibly for evading detection).

5. Smart Injection:
   - smartinject: If set to "true," it suggests that key function pointers will be embedded into the beacon for more efficient operation.

6. Checksum and Timestamp:
   - checksum: Specifies the checksum value.
   - compile_time: Indicates the compile time of the code.

7. Entry Point and Image Size:
   - entry_point: Specifies the entry point of the code.
   - image_size_x86 and image_size_x64: Define the image size for x86 and x64 architectures, respectively.

8. File Name and Rich Header:
   - name: Specifies the name of the post-exploitation DLL.
   - rich_header: Represents the modified rich header bytes.

9. String Transformations:
   - The transform-x86 and transform-x64 sections define transformations to replace specific strings in the code. This can be used to modify error messages or remove certain information.

10. AMSI (Antimalware Scan Interface) Disablement
- `amsi_disable`: When set to "false," it directs certain commands (`powerpick`, `execute-assembly`, and `psinject`) to patch the `AmsiScanBuffer` function, which helps in bypassing AMSI protection when loading .NET or PowerShell code.

# Obfuscate the scripts called by the aggressor scripts 

Some aggressor scripts use some external scripts and are called by the aggressor script when they run

EX: Load powershell script and execute it			
	bpowershell_import($bid,("/opt/amon-eye/load/alert.ps1"));
	bpowershell($bid, $cmd);
 
That's why I Obfuscate these texts to make the detection process more difficult.

Note üí¨Ô∏è
It is normal for any program file in this path (/opt/amon-eye/load) to be classified as malicious, because it is a program that is launched on the victim and is called internally from AM0N-Eye, and some of them can be encrypted or obfuscated to facilitate bypassing defensive machines.

# Demos for bypassing defensive machines
```
  Some demos where I was able to bypass some defensive machines.
  Note: I did not use any of the aggressor scripts or BOF in any of these demos,
  I only depend the new samples and the new Default profile.

to send toast notifications on behalf on an (installed) application or the computer itself. The user will be asked to supply credentials once they click on the notification toast. The second one is a AM0N-Eye module to launch the phishing attack on connected beacons and you can learn the types of victim's defense mechanisms and exploit this to issue an update alert or to take action

* (Active-Evilentry) 
job to execute as your current user context. This job will be executed every time the user logs in. Currently only works on Windows 7, 8, Server 2008, Server 2012.



* (UserSchtasksPersist)

Schtasks Persistence that runs as current user for the selected beacon

Meant for quick user level persistence upon initial access


* (ServiceEXEPersist)

Admin Level Custom Service EXE Persistence
    
Runs as elevated user/SYSTEM for the selected beacon



* (WMICEventPersist)
    
Generates a Custom WMI Event using WMIC for SYSTEM Level persistence on selected beacon

Very syntax heavy, Test first before using on live targets


* (StartupGPOPersist)
   
Generates a Local GPO Entry in psscripts.ini to call a .ps1 script file for persistence on selected beacon
   
Calls back as SYSTEM
   
Check permissions with GPO Enumeration (Successful GroupPolicy Directory Listing) first before executing
   
Beacon execution will cause winlogon.exe to hang and the end user can't login. Once the new beacon checks in inject into another process and kill the original. Update to come out soon.


* (RegistryPersist)

Creates a Custom Registry Key, Value, Type, and Payload Location based on user input for selected beacon



* (HKCURunKeyPSRegistryPersist)

Creates two Custom Registry Run Key entries in HKCU
   
The Payload is a base64 encoded powershell payload based off your HTTP/HTTPS listener

# Defensive Recon
AV/EDR  & EDR exact query
 
As a red-team practitioner, we are often using tools that attempt to fingerprint details about a compromised system, preferably in the most stealthy way possible. Some of our usual tooling for this started getting flagged by EDR products, due to the use of Windows CLI commands.
This aims to solve that problem by only probing the system using native registry queries, no CLI commands.
